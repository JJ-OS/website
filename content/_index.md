# Compose your Docs with __Ease__.

Compose is a lean theme for the `Hugo`, inspired by [forestry.io](https://forestry.io). 

We do a [Pull Request](https://github.com/onweru/compose/pulls) contributions workflow on **GitHub**. Also feel free to raise any issues or feature suggestions.

Note that the theme is built with simplicity in mind. This way, if a suggestion complicates the usability of the theme, it may be declined. New users are always welcome!
