## About JJ Linux

JJ linux is arch-based, but don't let that scare you off! Installing is as easy as opening the \[calamares\](https://calamares.io) installer, which is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. You have the full power of the \[AUR\](https://aur.archlinux.org) at your fingertips, with thousands of packages from system utils to games like minecraft. JJ Linux comes with 3 different desktops installed, so you can see which one you like the most. The whole point of the JJ  Linux project is to provide a linux distro designed to be easy and customizable.
